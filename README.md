# FMOD-EventBank-Organisation-scripts
Scripts to organise events assignments to banks.
Add to the Scripts folder in the FMOD application or to your project folder (add folder called Scripts): 

There are two scripts: 
•	One for adding single events to a bank - use with the shortcut (or add your own) for it to be more effective than the right-click method. 
•	The second script allows for adding multiple event to a bank, create a new bank, remove and re-organise events.

To add your own shortcut, open the script in a text editor and look for: "keysequence:".
